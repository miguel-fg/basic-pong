# Basic Pong Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to hit the ball with the paddles and prevent it from reaching the edges.

## Game Features
  - `Two-player game`: Play against a friend
  - `Simple controls`: Use `W`/`S` and `ArrowUp`/`ArrowDown` to control the paddles

## How to Run the Game
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser

## Game instructions
- To start the game, click the "Start Game" button on the screen
- Player 1 controls the left paddle with `W`/`S`
- Player 2 controls the right paddle with `ArrowUp`/`ArrowDown`
- When the ball hits a paddle, it will bounce back in the opposite direction, with added force
- If the ball reaches the left or right edge of the game area, the opposing player scores a point
- The game continues until one player reaches a specified score limit or until you decide to stop

## Areas of improvement
Given that this is my very first project in web development, the game is VERY basic in every aspect. I still consider it an important project as it helped me understand the foundations of web development.

- The scoring system are basic browser alerts
- The ball and paddle's physics feel unnatural
- The scoring area seems to move inward the longer a match goes
- The interface could use an overhaul
